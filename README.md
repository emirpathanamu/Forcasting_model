PROBLEM STATEMENT


The objective of this project is to build a forecasting model to predict the number of passengers for an airline company. The dataset contains historical values of the number of passengers, recorded monthly over a certain period. The aim is to use various forecasting algorithms, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, etc., to predict the future values of the number of passengers.

The primary goal of this project is to determine which forecasting algorithm performs best for the given airline passenger dataset. The accuracy of the forecasting models will be evaluated using standard metrics such as mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error. Additionally, the suitability of each algorithm to the specific time series dataset and the interpretability of the results will also be considered.

The final outcome of this project will be the selection of the most accurate and appropriate forecasting algorithm for the given airline passenger dataset. This will enable the airline company to forecast future passenger demand with greater accuracy and confidence, allowing for better planning and decision-making.
